- Blockchain as immutable, sequential chain of records ("blocks")
- Blocks chained together via hashes
- Blocks contain:
    1. Index
    2. Timestamp (UNIX time)
    3. List of transactions
    4. A "proof"
    5. Hash of previous block
        -> If earlier block is corrupted, all following blocks will contain incorrect hashes
- Blocks mined on blockchain via Proof of Work algorithm
    -> Finds number that is "difficult to find, but easy to verify" from function
- Mining endpoint:
    1. Calculates proof of work
    2. Rewards miner by adding transaction, giving us one coin
    3. Forge the new block by adding it to chain
